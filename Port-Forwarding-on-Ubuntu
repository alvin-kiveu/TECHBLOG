## Port Forwarding on Ubuntu

Port forwarding is a technique used to allow external devices to access services on a private network by directing traffic from a specific port on your public IP address to a specific port on a device within your internal network. It is often used to enable access to servers, applications, or services running on your network that would otherwise be inaccessible from the outside world.


## How Port Forwarding Works


Port forwarding works by creating a mapping between a port on your public IP address and a port on a device within your internal network. When an external device sends traffic to the public IP address and port that is being forwarded, the router or firewall that is performing the port forwarding will redirect the traffic to the specified internal device and port.


For example, if you have a web server running on port 80 on a device within your internal network and you want to make it accessible from the internet, you can set up port forwarding to direct traffic from port 80 on your public IP address to the internal IP address of the web server.


Check if IP Forwarding is Enabled:

```bash
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
```

If the output is `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0`, IP forwarding is disabled. To enable it, run:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

To make the change persistent across reboots, edit the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file and add the following line:

```bash
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```

Save the file and apply the changes by running:

```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```

## Add the Port Forwarding Rule:

Eg if you want to forward traffic from port 80 on your public IP address to port 80 on an internal device with IP address `
